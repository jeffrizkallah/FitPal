## Phase 1 — Foundation & Auth

**Goal:** Scaffold the project, set up the DB, and get a user signed in.

| Task | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Init Next.js project with Tailwind | ✅ | App Router, TypeScript, package.json, tsconfig, next.config |
| Configure Neon DB project (postgres, branching) | ✅ | Schema pushed. Scripts use dotenv-cli. Reset script in scripts/reset-db.mjs |
| Set up Auth (NextAuth.js or Clerk) | ✅ | NextAuth.js v5 — credentials provider + optional Google OAuth. auth.ts, middleware.ts |
| Design DB schema (users, workouts, meals, logs) | ✅ | db/schema.ts — auth_users + users + exercises, plans, sessions, sets, meals, summaries, messages |
| Build sign-up / sign-in screens (email + OAuth) | ✅ | Custom DLS forms — sign-in uses signIn(), sign-up calls POST /api/auth/register |
| User profile onboarding flow (goals, stats) | ✅ | app/onboarding — AI chat flow: greeting → biometrics → gym photo (optional) → week plan → handoff animation. Routes: /api/onboarding/parse-profile, /api/onboarding/generate-plan. haptic.handoff() double-pulse. |
| Global layout, navigation shell | ✅ | BottomNav (Home/Train/Fuel/Advisor) with blur backdrop, active state |
| Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing) | ✅ | tailwind.config.ts — Neumorphic DLS palette (#e0e0e0 base, dual shadows), type scale, animations |

---

## Phase 2 — Workout Tracker (Pillar II: The Plan)

**Goal:** One-exercise-at-a-time guided workout experience.

| Task | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Exercise library (seeded in Neon DB) | ✅ | 32 exercises across all muscle groups. Run: npm run db:seed. No video assets yet (Phase 6). |
| Workout plan builder (AI-generated or manual) | ✅ | /workout/plan/new — exercise picker + sets/reps editor + day-of-week assignment (M-S buttons). |
| Weekly Train view — day accordion | ✅ | /workout — 7 day pills, expand day → see exercises. Tap circle to complete (localStorage). Chevron shows muscle SVG + instructions. |
| Exercise completion (tap-to-done) | ✅ | Per-day localStorage key. Completion resets each calendar day automatically. |
| Muscle diagram SVGs per exercise | ✅ | Inline SVG human silhouette with highlighted region per muscle group (WeeklyPlanView component). |
| dayOfWeek column on plan_exercises | ✅ | Schema updated, db:push run. 0=Mon…6=Sun, null=unscheduled. |
| Active workout screen — single-exercise focus view | ⏸ | Deferred — old flow retained at /workout/active but not surfaced in main UI anymore. |
| Rest timer with haptic signatures | ✅ | lib/haptics.ts — haptic.success(), haptic.alert(), haptic.timer(), haptic.heavy(). Used in ActiveWorkout. |
| Set/rep/weight logging (minimal input) | ⏸ | Deferred — simplified to tap-to-complete model. Detailed logging can return in Phase 4 via AI. |
| Workout summary & history | ✅ | /workout/summary/[sessionId] — duration, sets, volume. /workout/history — session list with set counts. |
| Volume/intensity adjustment via AI prompt | ⏸ | Blocked — requires Phase 4 (AI Advisor) LLM integration |
| AI-generated weekly plan | ⏸ | Blocked — requires Phase 4 LLM. AI will assign exercises to days automatically. |
| \"Dynamic Island\" style header during active workout | ✅ | WorkoutIsland component — floating pill overlay (fixed top center), shows exercise, set dots, rest timer. Framer Motion spring animation. Tap to expand with full timer + link to /workout/active. |

## Phase 3 — Vision Nutrition Tracker (Pillar III: The Fuel)

**Goal:** Point, shoot, confirm — AI handles the math.

| Task | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Camera UI (full-screen, minimal chrome) | ✅ | /nutrition/log — file input with capture="environment", image preview well |
| Vision AI integration for food identification | ✅ | claude-opus-4-6 vision via @anthropic-ai/sdk. POST /api/nutrition/analyze |
| Calorie & macro estimation pipeline | ✅ | Returns name, mealType, calories, protein, carbs, fat, items breakdown |
| Meal confirmation screen (edit if needed) | ✅ | All macro fields editable. Meal type selector (4 options). |
| Daily nutrition log & summary | ✅ | /nutrition — macro progress bars (cal/protein/carbs/fat). Meal list with MealCard. |
| Protein / macro gap alerts | ✅ | Inset alert shown when protein >30g below target or calories >400 below with logged meals. |
| Semantic meal refinement (voice / text) | ✅ | "Refinement" input on confirm screen → re-calls analyze with context. |

## Phase 4 — AI Advisor (Pillar I: The Advisor)

**Goal:** Persistent LLM that knows the user's biology, history, and environment.

| Task | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| LLM integration (chat + voice input) | ✅ | claude-opus-4-6 streaming via @anthropic-ai/sdk. POST /api/advisor/chat returns ReadableStream. |
| Persistent user context memory in Neon DB | ✅ | advisorMessages table — role, content, createdAt. GET /api/advisor/messages loads history. Last 20 messages fed to Claude. |
| Advisor chat UI (minimal, coach-like) | ✅ | /advisor — streaming chat, neumorphic bubbles (inset=user, raised=AI), dot-bounce typing indicator, auto-scroll, auto-resize textarea. |
| Routine adjustment actions from chat | ✅ | Claude tool use: update_exercise (sets/reps/weight/rest on planExercises) + update_macro_targets (users table). Transparent streaming — tools execute server-side, follow-up response streams to client. |
| Gym equipment inventory (Vision scan → DB) | ✅ | gym_equipment table in schema. POST /api/advisor/equipment/scan — Vision AI identifies equipment from photo. /advisor/equipment — list, scan, delete UI. Equipment included in advisor system prompt. |

## Phase 5 — Contextual Intelligence

**Goal:** The app knows where you are and reconfigures itself accordingly.

| Task | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Location detection (gym / restaurant / home) | ✅ | Browser Geolocation API + Haversine distance (≤250m = at gym). Time-based fallback: mealtime windows (11:30–14:30, 17:30–20:30), recovery (21:00–05:30). |
| Dynamic UI mode switching | ✅ | ContextualQuickStart reorders CTAs: gym→workout first, mealtime→meal first, recovery→advisor first. Mode banner with accent stripe. |
| Gym onboarding via Vision AI (equipment scan) | ✅ | gymLatitude/gymLongitude added to users table. "Set gym location" CTA on home screen saves current GPS. Equipment scan already in /advisor/equipment (Phase 4). |
